Before joining Sony AI, I was a Ph.D. researcher under SenseTime-NTU Talent Programme and obtained Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University, advised by [Prof. Yonggang Wen](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/ygwen/). 
Prior to that, I had years of experimence in software engineering, focusing on build large-scale distributed systems. I obtained my Bachelor's from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.
