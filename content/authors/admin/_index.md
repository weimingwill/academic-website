I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. 

I am in Cloud Computing Platform and Application Group (CAP), NTU, supervised by [Prof. Yonggang Wen](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/ygwen/). Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree from National University of Singapore.
